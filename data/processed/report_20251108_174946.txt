AI-GENERATED SUMMARY
============================================================
**Daily HackerNews Brief**

Today's headlines are dominated by AI-related topics, reflecting the growing skepticism in the tech industry about the hype surrounding Large Language Models (LLMs). Here's what caught our attention:

* Tech stocks took a hit as investors lose confidence in AI's potential ($1T sold off).
* LLM makers are accused of exaggerating their benchmarks' capabilities.
* Zig, a new programming language, is gaining traction with its performance and simplicity.

On the other hand, some positive news emerged:

* Valdi, a cross-platform UI framework, delivers native performance without sacrificing flexibility.
* A group of friends accidentally "leaked" fake information about AMD's Ryzen 7 9700X3D, highlighting the importance of fact-checking in tech reporting.

As AI continues to shape the industry, engineers should be aware of the growing skepticism and uncertainty surrounding its capabilities. Stay informed and keep an eye on emerging trends like Zig and Valdi.
